# Desktop Environment
Here are my DE configuration.

## [`niri.nix`](./niri.nix)
Here are my [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) configurations.

Niri is a *tiling window manager* putting windows in an infinite strip going to the right.

Pros:
- The special window managing algorithm make the window easier to manage.

Cons:
- It's a bit confusing.
- Sometimes I'm missing openend windows.

## [`bar.nix`](./bar.nix)
Here are my bar configuration. I'm currently using i3bar-river as my bar and i3status-rust as
feeder.

`i3bar-river` is a port of i3bar (a part of i3 project) to river and some other WMs.

Pros:
- Customizable

Cons:
- Not very customizable

`i3status-rust` is a rewrite of i3status in Rust.

Pros:
- Written in Rust.

Cons:
- No many built-in components.
