## Hierarchy

Here are files in root directory.

- [`flake.nix`](./flake.nix) - The root file of the flake
- [`hardware-config.nix`](./hardware-config.nix) - Magics generated by `nixos-generate-config`
- [`fonts.nix`](./fonts.nix) - Config fonts systemwide
- [`home.nix`](./home.nix) - The entry of the home-manager config
- [`configuration.nix`](./configuration.nix) - Random systemwide configs that
  will be separated
- [`software-config/`](./software-config/) - Random software configs in
  home-manager that is hard to modularize
- [`modules/`](./modules/) - Modules of my config.
- [`justfile`](./justfile) - Useful commands
