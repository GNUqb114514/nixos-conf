## Overview

  - A devshell
  - A lot of substituters for nixpkgs
    > [!NOTE]
    > My network sucks.
  - GRUB as bootloader
    > [!NOTE]
    > Its UI is more clean.

  - [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww)
    > [!NOTE]
    > Migration to quickshell scheduled due to the complexity of eww.
  - [Fcitx 5](https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx5)
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configured by [`nvf`](https://github.com/notashelf/nvf)

## Todo

- [ ] Document everything
- [ ] Move things to home-manager from systemwide config
- [ ] Find a better browser (or write one)
- [x] Make this config more practical
- [ ] Migrate to quickshell
- [ ] Try more new things

## Hierarchy

Here are files in root directory.

- [`flake.nix`](./flake.nix) - The root file of the flake
- [`hardware-config.nix`](./hardware-config.nix) - Magics generated by `nixos-generate-config`
- [`fonts.nix`](./fonts.nix) - Config fonts systemwide
- [`home.nix`](./home.nix) - The entry of the home-manager config
- [`configuration.nix`](./configuration.nix) - Random systemwide configs that
  will be separated
- [`software-config/`](./software-config/) - Random software configs in
  home-manager that is hard to modularize
- [`modules/`](./modules/) - Modules of my config.
- [`justfile`](./justfile) - Useful commands

For detailed explanation see readme files in each folders.
